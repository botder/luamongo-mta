Usage:
	Just read through luamongo's README.md. That contains about all information you need in
	terms of connecting, querying, and so on.

	require('mongo') isn't needed.

Compiling
(only done on Windows so far, links lead to the files -I- used)
	1. Downloading stuff.
		* download mongodb-cxx-driver
		  http://downloads.mongodb.org/cxx-driver/mongodb-linux-x86_64-v2.0-latest.tgz

		* download pcre-7.4
		  http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/pcre/pcre/7.4/pcre-7.4.zip
		  and read instructions (needs to rename some *.generic and some *.in files, depends on your platform)

		* download python
		  http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6.msi

		* download scons
		  http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/scons/scons/1.2.0/scons-1.2.0.win32.exe

		* download boost precompiled libs
		  http://www.mongodb.org/download/attachments/12157032/boost_1_42_vs2008_partial_prebuilt.7z

		* download luamongo
		  https://github.com/mabako/luamongo; I've compiled it with the 'master' branch.

	2. Extracting
		/ - files from luamongo-mta (everything in here) AND all *.lib files from boost/lib.
		/mongo - files from luamongo
		/mongo/boost - files from boost/boost (lots of subdirectories, some *.hpp files)
		/mongo/mongo - files from mongodb-cxx-driver (contains SConstruct file)
		/mongo/mongo/pcre-7.4 - PCRE files

	3. Compiling
		* run in the directory with SConstruct
		  scons mongoclient.lib
		  
		  This is most likely causing issues. The SConstruct file I've used is in SConstruct.win32.vs2008.

		* build the project (this should toss roughly a hundred of warnings about symbols while linking)
		  If some boost libs are missing in RELEASE, I've changed the names with smaller filenames to match those.
		  That's prolly dumb, but it works.
